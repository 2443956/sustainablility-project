            <h2>Ensuring Access to Clean Water and Sanitation for All</h2>
            <p>water is a necessity to live but not everyone has it, the statistics highlight an extremely important issue:  2.2 billion people around the world will have no access to safe drinking water this year. The situation is just as bad for hygiene, with 3.5 billion people without safe handwashing and safely managed sanitation facilities. this problem is emphasized by the fact that 2.4 billion people live in water-scarce countries. These challenges not only are a problem to health but also overall environmental sustainability. Our mission is to help reach our 2030 goals, to do that we need to push for a six times increase in drinking water efforts, a five-times increase in sanitation, and a three-times increase in hygiene efforts to Fix these problems. By doing this we can create a future where everyone has access to clean water and proper sanitation. which is necessary for a healthy and sustainable world.</p>
