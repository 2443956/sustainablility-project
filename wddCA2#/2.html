            <h2>World Hungar</h2>
            <p>The United Nations is trying to end world hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. More than 600 million people worldwide are expected to face hunger in 2030. We as a species must not let this happen.</p>
        </section>
		<section>
			<h2>Our Goals</h2>
			<p>The United Nations wants to end hunger by 2030, end malnutrition by 2025, and double agricultural productivity and incomes for small-scale food producers. Sustainable food production systems and strong agricultural practices are also vitally important. By 2020, the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, and wild species should be maintained. Investments into rural infrastructure, agricultural research, and technology development are needed to increase agricultural capacity in developing countries. Trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets should be corrected and prevented. Proper functioning of food commodity markets and timely access to market information are also essential to limit extreme food price volatility.</p>

			<h2>Our solutions</h2>
			<p>The solution to food scarcity is to improve food distribution systems, put in social safety nets, encourage local food production, provide nutritional education, and fortify essential foods. Access to resources, financial services, and training in sustainable farming techniques are also crucial. Agroecology, climate-resilient crops, and efficient irrigation systems are also essential. Seed banks and breeding programs are also crucial. Protecting traditional knowledge and promoting international cooperation, research, and rural infrastructure are also essential. Policy reform, fair trade practices, and eliminating subsidies are also crucial. Market transparency, price stabilization funds, and efficient market systems are also essential.</p>
		</section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Implementing those solutions for these targets requires coordinated efforts from governments, NGOs, the private sector, and communities. With dedicated resources and a commitment to sustainability, these targets can be achieved.</p>
